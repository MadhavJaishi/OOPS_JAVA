Encapsulation means it binds data and code together into a single unit. It provides data integrity, modularity(managed data & reusability) and data hiding. Ex: Classes, Capsule of medicine, ATMs.
Example program -
//A Java class which is a fully encapsulated class.  
//It has a private data member and getter and setter methods.  
public class Student{  
    //private data member  
    private String name;  
    //getter method for name  
    public String getName() {  
        return name;  
    }  
    //setter method for name  
    public void setName(String name) {  
        this.name=name;
    }  
}
