The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body. It can't be instantiated just like abstract class.
It is used to achieve loose coupling, abstraction and multiple inheritance.
Example program to achieve multiple inheritance using interface -
interface Printable{  
    void print();  
}  
interface Showable{  
    void show();  
}  
class A7 implements Printable,Showable{  
    public void print(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
    public void show(){System.out.println("Welcome");}  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        A7 obj = new A7();  
        obj.print();  // Hello
        obj.show();  // Welcome
    }  
}
